# Tarina

> Tarina means story in Finnish

Write your stories, one step at a time. Focused on publishing, searching and discovering new stories, quickly and easily.

## Introduction

Application created by Andr√©s Lazo, to practice the basic elements of Next JS.

At the moment I work on:

- Layouts
- Routing
- Server-side components
- Use of Tailwind
- Improving the styling

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
