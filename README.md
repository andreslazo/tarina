## Introduction

Application created by AndrÃ©s Lazo, to practice the basic elements of Next JS.

At the moment I work on:

- Layouts
- Routing
- Server-side components
- Use of Tailwind
- Improving the styling
- First steps towards a fully responsive app and design
- Firebase usage
- Loading states

## Getting Started

1. Be sure you have the latest requirements. Using a runtime version manager like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) is highly recommended.

- Node JS 20.11.0

2. Install all the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure all the env variables copying the example file and editing it

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

4. Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
