# Tarina

> Tarina means story in Finnish

Write your stories, one step at a time. Focused on publishing, searching and discovering new stories, quickly and easily.

## Introduction

Application created by Andr√©s Lazo, to practice the basic elements of Next JS.

At the moment I work on:

- Layouts
- Routing
- Server-side components
- Use of Tailwind
- Improving the styling
- First steps towards a fully responsive app and design

## Getting Started

First, be sure you have the latest requirements. Using a runtime version manager like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) is highly recommended.

- Node JS 20.11.0

And install all the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
